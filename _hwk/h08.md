* Homework assignments will be done online in the Gradescope system: [https://www.gradescope.com/courses/444948](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/444948).
* Please pay close attention to the instructions, especially when asking to provide the answer
	* Many questions are autograded by the system, which does a character-by-character comparison of the correct answer and your submitted answer.
	* Please be **PRECISE** and **EXACT** in your solutions in this case, otherwise your answer will not be considered correct.
* You may save your work at any time before the deadline (and I highly encourage this!). You may also resubmit your work any time before the deadline. We will only grade your latest submission.
